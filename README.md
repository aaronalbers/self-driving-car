# Formula nOne

A bot that loses at Rocket League using [RLBot].

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Windows

  RLBot only works on Windows, and we inherit this limitation.

* Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

* Install [pre-commit], and run this command:

  ```sh
  pre-commit install
  ```

  This will run tests/lints/etc before every commit. The bot may lose every
  game, but at least the code will be pretty!

* Obtain these files from [RLBot] and copy them into `target/debug` and `target/release`:
  * `RLBot_Core.dll`
  * `RLBot_Core_Interface.dll`
  * `RLBot_Injector.exe`

[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/
[RLBot]: http://www.rlbot.org/

### Watch the bot play

```sh
cargo run -p play
```

### Run the bot with the RLBot framework

```sh
cargo build && python -c "from rlbot import runner; runner.main()"
```

### Run integration tests

The integration tests require a copy of Rocket League running (naturally).

```sh
cargo test -p brain -- --test-threads=1 integration_tests
```

To run an individual test, you can replace `integration_tests` with a pattern
that matches the name of the test.

### Build a tournament package

```sh
scripts/tourney.sh
```

This will package up a release build in `target/tournament/`. It will also
modify the local `rlbot.cfg` for quick testing. You can test the build by
starting Rocket League and then running:

```sh
( cd target/tournament && python -c "from rlbot import runner; runner.main()" )
```

Once you know it works, zip up the directory and send it to the tournament
organizer!

## Roadmap

### Next

- add the offense swing-around stuff (when no good shot angle)
- backwards tepid hits should not dodge? (maybe all tepid hits)
- BounceShot (and related) should verify the hit happened, and Action::Abort if
  not
- don't jump directly after skidding and go the wrong way (probably test yaw vs
  velocity angle and see if match)
- QuickJumpAndDodge should allow choosing the angle at apex instead of only
  ahead of time

### Backlog

- shoot: choose bounce shot or ground shot depending on whether ball is bouncing
- [chip recovery](https://pastebin.com/XtFL5JzV)
- generic long-range pathfinding
  - if far away, waiting stationary, and turned the wrong way, fix yaw before
    sitting still
  - if in TIME CRUNCH MODE, just blitz to destination
  - otherwise: weave for pennies, opportunistic demos, etc
- diagonal kickoff
- if inside a goal, never drive in a path that overlaps inner walls of goal
- fix whiffs when retreating redirects to corner
- stop panicking if panicking is no longer necessary
- [half flip](https://discordapp.com/channels/348658686962696195/348661571297214465/489479593632464901)
- car-ball interacion simulation
