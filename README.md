# Formula nOne

A bot that loses at Rocket League using [RLBot].

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Windows

  RLBot only works on Windows, and we inherit this limitation.

* Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

* Install [pre-commit], and run this command:

  ```sh
  pre-commit install
  ```

  This will run tests/lints/etc before every commit. The bot may lose every
  game, but at least the code will be pretty!

* Obtain these files from [RLBot] and copy them into `target/debug` and `target/release`:
  * `RLBot_Core.dll`
  * `RLBot_Core_Interface.dll`
  * `RLBot_Injector.exe`

[RLBot]: http://www.rlbot.org/

### Watch the bot play

```sh
cargo run -p play
```

### Run integration tests

The integration tests require a copy of Rocket League running (naturally). There
are a lot of moving parts, so be warned that this is a somewhat finicky
endeavor.

1.  Start BakkesMod.

2.  Start Rocket League. BakkesMod should inject itself successfully.

3.  Run the tests.

    ```sh
    cargo test -p brain -- --test-threads=1 integration_tests
    ```

    To run an individual test, you can replace `integration_tests` with a
    pattern that matches the name of the test.

Plan:

- powerslide in simple_steer_towards related stuff
- shoot: choose bounce shot or ground shot depending on whether ball is bouncing
- shoot: increase valid z-range in intercept estimation, and add ability to jump
- do the vector calulation for shots so as to not miss every shot
- bounce shot: come up with some heuristic to aim slightly better (i.e. make the tests pass, aiming for the exact middle of goal)
- defense averting insanity --> blitz to goal with an idea of which direction to turn
- workaround for root capture interruption
- chip recovery
- finish chip bvh
- add the offense swing-around stuff (when no good shot angle)
- defense averting insanity --> blitz to goal with an idea of which direction to turn
