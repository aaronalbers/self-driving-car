# Formula nOne

A bot that loses at Rocket League using [RLBot].

## Development

### Prerequisites

* This code only works on Windows (because RLBot itself only works on Windows).
* Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
* Install [pre-commit].
* Run this command:

  ```sh
  pre-commit install
  ```

  This will run tests/lints/etc before every commit. The bot may lose every
  game, but at least the code will be pretty!

* Obtain these files from [RLBot] and copy them into `target/debug` and `target/release`:
  * `RLBot_Core.dll`
  * `RLBot_Core_Interface.dll`
  * `RLBot_Injector.exe`

[RLBot]: http://www.rlbot.org/

### Watch the bot play

```sh
cargo run -p play
```

### Run integration tests

The integration tests require a copy of Rocket League running (naturally). There
are a lot of moving parts, so be warned that this is a somewhat finicky
endeavor.

1.  Start BakkesMod.

2.  Start Rocket League. BakkesMod should inject itself successfully.

3.  Run the tests.

    ```sh
    cargo test -p brain -- --test-threads=1 integration_tests
    ```

    To run an individual test, you can replace `integration_tests` with a
    pattern that will match the name of the test of interest.
