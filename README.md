# Formula nOne

A bot that loses at Rocket League using [RLBot].

[RLBot]: http://www.rlbot.org/

## Development

### Prerequisites

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

### First-time setup

```sh
pre-commit install
```

The bot may always lose, but at the code will be pretty.

### Watch the bot play

```sh
cargo run -p play
```

### Run tests

The tests require a copy of Rocket League running (naturally). There are a lot
of moving parts, so be warned that this is a somewhat finicky endeavor.

1. Start BakkesMod.

2. Start Rocket League. BakkesMod should inject itself successfully.

3. Run the tests.

   ```sh
   cargo test -- --test-threads=1 
   ```
